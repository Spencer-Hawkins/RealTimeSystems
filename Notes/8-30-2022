Real Time Systems:

 Def. A Real time system is a system for whuch correctness depends on both logical correctness (doing the right thing) and temporal correctness (going it on time)

Examples:
  -school bell
  -autonomous vehicles
  -virtual reality
  -High Frequency Trading
  
  
Task              T_i     -computation executed on CPU
Computation time  C_i     -time required for task to compute
Relative Deadline D_i     -how much time we have to complete task  
Job               T_i,k   -instance of a task
Release time      R_i,k   -time job becomes ready for execution
absolute dealine  d_i,k   -time by which job must be completed


     r_i,k                             ╲╱
T_i __^_______________________________d_i,k ______


Usefulnes V.S. Time
  -Hard deadlines have no usefulness after deadline
  -Soft deadlines decrease in usefulness after deadline


safety-critical system:
  -there is human or economic, or physical impact to this system
  -cyber-physical system. There is physical component (robotic arm) and code that controls how physical component operates
